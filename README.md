# Simple Network Port Scanner

## Description

This port scanner allows you to specify a target IP address and a range of TCP ports to scan. It reports which ports are open, helping you understand which services are exposed on a networked device. Port scanning is a foundational skill for penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and network defense.

## Features

- Scans a range of TCP ports on a target host
- Reports open ports
- Fast scanning using threading
- Handles unreachable hosts gracefully
- Simple command-line interface

---

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.

---

## Usage

Run the script in your terminal:

python simple_port_scanner.py


You will be prompted to enter:
- The target IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1)
- The start port (e.g., 1)
- The end port (e.g., 1024)
